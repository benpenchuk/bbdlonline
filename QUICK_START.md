# Quick Start: Running the Application Locally

Here are the steps to run the application on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) must be installed on your system.

### Steps

1.  **Open your terminal.**

2.  **Navigate to the frontend project directory.**
    Replace `path/to/your/project` with the actual path on your machine.
    ```bash
    
    cd path/to/your/project/bbdl-frontend
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies (if you haven't already).**
    This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all the necessary libraries for the project to run. You only need to do this once.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Start the development server.**
    This command launches the application in development mode.
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

This will automatically open the application in your default web browser, usually at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**.

The server will watch for any file changes you make, and it will automatically reload the page to reflect your updates.
