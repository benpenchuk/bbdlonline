  onViewChange: (view: ViewMode) => void;
}
```

**PlayerCard**
```typescript
interface PlayerCardProps {
  player: Player;

## üîÑ Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
None! The redesign is fully backward compatible with existing data structures.

### Removed Features (Simplified UX)

1. **Player Search** - Re-add search box with debounce
2. **Advanced Filters** - Filter by year, team, record
3. **Sort Options** - Sort by wins, avg points, name
4. **Player Comparison** - Select 2+ players to compare stats
5. **Edit Player** - Inline editing or dedicated edit modal
6. **Team Stats Summary** - Expanded stats at team section header
7. **Animations** - Framer Motion for advanced spring physics
8. **Dark Mode** - Toggle for dark theme
9. **Print View** - CSS for printing player roster
10. **Export** - Export player list as CSV/PDF
